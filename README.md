# Banking-Regulation
This project is focused on a critical analysis of the current status of the Basel proposal in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and on measuring your ability to estimate capital requirements for a set  of operations.

In the case study of the small bank in Ontario, the total-coupons, bond-prices and capital requirements have been worked out. Further analysis shows the inverse relationship between risk-free-rate and the bond-prices. Itâ€™s observed that, to remain solvent, the bank needs to increase its capital.

During COVID-19, with current acceptance of Basel norms, the banks worldwide, were able to absorb the economic-shock caused by the pandemic. For Indian-banking-system it was challenging because of history of the bad debt, high defaults and low provisions, but with strict monitoring, stimulus packages, fiscal-policies and increase in market capitalization the impact of pandemic was withstood. India can further boost up its economy with the implementation of Basel-IV reforms likely in 2-3 years after 2029.
